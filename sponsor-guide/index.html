			<h1>Who Are We, and Why Are We Here?</h1>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, Howard University has hosted a number of hackathons
				through generous contributions by single company sponsors. These events have been relatively small, and
				only open to students at our university. The main problem that we have come to realize, however, is that, unlike
				many of the larger hackathons that are often seen being hosted at schools across the country, our hackathons
				have lacked access to the hardware and the wide variety of engineering mentors that these bigger ones tend
				to have in droves. This has put us at a direct disadvantage, and lessened our students' potential to
				really go all out and create amazing things on the level of their peers from other colleges and
				universities.
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of the students on the <b>HowU Hack 2016</b> organizing committee have
				both participated in, and even won prizes at, hackathons hosted at these other schools. The potential is
				here. And we believe that it exists, not just at Howard, but also at the many other HBCUs throughout the
				United States—schools with future engineers and tech innovators who, like many of our students, just
				haven't had the opportunity to show the world what they're truly made of. With our hackathon, we plan to
				do just that.
			</p>
			<br>
			
			<h1>What Can You Gain When You Sponsor Our Hackathon?</h1><br>
			
			<h2 class="perks-bene">Real Time Feedback on Your Products</h2>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any hardware or APIs out there that you want people to use? Are
				you excited by the possibility of having real students, of varying backgrounds and experience levels,
				enthusiastic about creating something on one or more of your platforms? Of possibly opening new
				doors, and seeing the real potential in your products that maybe even you haven’t yet considered?
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the beauty of the hackathon. It is one of the few places where
				talented individuals from all walks of life can come together to create wonderful products in a
				relatively short period of time—to crank out revolutionary ideas and turn them into reality with the
				help of pre-existing platforms and technology.
			</p>
			<h2 class="perks-bene">Meet Talented Students in a One-on-One Environment</h2>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sponsors and their representatives will have a chance to meet and connect
				with students on a level that is a lot more personal than a paper resume, or even a 45-minute
				technical interview or two. At a hackathon, you will be able to encourage and interact with budding
				technical and innovative talent first-hand, and even help them to learn more about you, and what you
				have to offer as a company.
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’d be surprised by how great of an impact a good mentor can have on a
				student when it comes time to apply for an internship—or even narrowing down the choices between
				offers when deadlines start creeping up. Being able to connect a company with a face and a
				pleasant experience can make all the difference in the world when it matters most.
